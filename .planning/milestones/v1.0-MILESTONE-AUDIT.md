# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** gaps_found
**Milestone:** v1.0 MVP — Small DataSet Audio

## Executive Summary

All 10 phases are complete with 33/33 plans executed. 10/10 phase VERIFICATION.md files read. Cross-phase integration is strong (160+ verified imports, 6/6 E2E flows functional). However, **one critical integration gap** prevents the core feature (musically meaningful slider controls) from working end-to-end: `LatentSpaceAnalyzer` is never instantiated in the application flow.

**Score: 33/40 requirements satisfied** (7 partial due to the analysis gap)

## Phase Verification Summary

|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1. Project Setup | passed | 22/22 | All truths, artifacts, links verified |
| 2. Data Pipeline | passed (gap closed) | 5/5 | Export gap from verification was fixed (augmentation now in audio/__init__.py) |
| 3. Core Training Engine | passed | 9/9 | Re-verified, no regressions |

| 7. Presets & History | passed | 12/12 | All truths verified |
| 8. Gradio UI | passed | 9/9 | All truths verified |
| 9. CLI Interface | passed | 9/9 | All truths verified |
| 10. Multi-Format Export & Spatial | human_needed | 29/29 | Code verified, 6 tests pending, HRTF file needed |

## Critical Gap: Latent Space Analysis Integration

**The Problem:** `LatentSpaceAnalyzer` (Phase 5) is fully implemented and tested in isolation, but **never called** anywhere in the application. This means:

1. After training completes, no latent space analysis runs
2. Models are saved/loaded without `AnalysisResult`
3. The Generate tab hides slider controls (no analysis = no sliders)
4. Preset save/load is non-functional (presets store slider positions that don't exist)
5. The core value proposition — "musically meaningful parameter controls" — is broken end-to-end

**Evidence:**
- `grep -r "LatentSpaceAnalyzer(" src/` returns 0 instantiations
- Training loop (`training/loop.py`) has no latent analysis step
- Library tab save handler (`ui/tabs/library_tab.py`) has no analysis step
- CLI train command (`cli/train.py`) has no analysis step

**Impact:** 7 requirements partially unsatisfied (GEN-02 through GEN-08)

**Recommended Fix:** Add `LatentSpaceAnalyzer.analyze()` call in one of:
- Post-training flow in train tab (auto-analyze after training completes)
- Model save flow in library tab (analyze before saving .sda)
- CLI command `sda model analyze MODEL`

### Partial (7/40) — Blocked by LatentSpaceAnalyzer Gap

| Requirement | Phase | Issue |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| GEN-02: Control density | 5 | Slider infrastructure exists but analyzer never runs |
| GEN-03: Control timbral params | 5 | Slider infrastructure exists but analyzer never runs |
| GEN-04: Control harmonic tension | 5 | Slider infrastructure exists but analyzer never runs |
| GEN-05: Control temporal character | 5 | Slider infrastructure exists but analyzer never runs |
| GEN-06: Control spatial/textural | 5 | Slider infrastructure exists but analyzer never runs |
| GEN-07: System maps latent space via PCA | 5 | LatentSpaceAnalyzer code works but is never called |
| GEN-08: Slider range limits | 5 | Safe range code exists but depends on analysis |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration Score: 9.5/10**

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Phase 1 → All (config/hardware) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 (audio/training) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 3 → Phase 4 (model/inference) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 3 → Phase 5 (training → analysis) | MISSING |
| Phase 4 → Phase 8/9 (generation → UI/CLI) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 5 → Phase 6 (analysis → persistence) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 5 → Phase 8 (sliders → UI) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 6 → Phase 8/9 (library → UI/CLI) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 7 → Phase 8/9 (presets/history → UI/CLI) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 8 → Phase 9 (UI → CLI entry) | CONNECTED |
| Phase 10 → Phase 4/8/9 (export/spatial/blend) | CONNECTED |

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Import → Train → Generate → Export | COMPLETE |
| Model Save → Load → Generate | COMPLETE (without sliders) |
| Preset Save → Load → Generate | COMPLETE (without sliders) |
| CLI Train → CLI Generate | COMPLETE |
| Multi-model Blend | COMPLETE |
| Spatial Audio | COMPLETE |

All 6 flows work end-to-end, but flows involving slider controls degrade to random sampling without analysis.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 4: Audio Quality
- 6 human listening/verification tests pending (spectral analysis, crossfade quality, latent interpolation smoothness, multi-format export, stereo field, sidecar metadata)

### Phase 5: Musically Meaningful Controls
- 4 human listening tests pending (slider perceptual validation, PCA label accuracy, safe range effectiveness, seed reproducibility)

### Phase 10: Multi-Format Export & Spatial
- HRTF SOFA file not bundled (binaural mode requires user download from sofacoustics.org)
- 6 human verification tests pending (format quality, metadata tags, binaural spatial, blend quality, spatial controls, CLI workflow)

## Recommendation

**Close the LatentSpaceAnalyzer gap before completing milestone.** This is a 1-phase fix:

Wire `LatentSpaceAnalyzer.analyze()` into the post-training flow (after training completes in both UI and CLI), and into the model save flow (library tab). This connects the existing Phase 5 code to the application and enables the core feature.

Run `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` to create the fix phase, or accept as tech debt and proceed with `/gsd:complete-milestone`.
