# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

**Core value:** Controllable exploration — users can reliably navigate between sound worlds using musically meaningful parameters
**Current focus:** Phase 1 (Project Setup)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Project Setup)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (hardware detection, memory, benchmark)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] ~7%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks, 20 files | 3min |
| Phase 01 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks, 3 files | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min, 3min
- Trend: Consistent

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Non-real-time generation (quality over latency)
- Phase 1: Python + Gradio for v1 (fastest path to usable tool)
- Phase 4: 48kHz/24bit baseline (professional audio production standard)
- Phase 5: Novel approach emphasis (research-grade innovation, not just wrapper)
- [Phase 01]: Used dependency-groups.dev instead of deprecated tool.uv.dev-dependencies
- [Phase 01]: TOML config uses 0/0.0 for unset numeric fields (TOML has no null type)
- [Phase 01]: Config module has zero PyTorch dependency for error reporting resilience
- [Phase 01]: Deep merge strategy for config forward compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Explicit CUDA -> MPS -> CPU detection chain for predictability (not torch.accelerator)
- [Phase 01]: Smoke test on non-CPU devices catches "available but broken" GPUs
- [Phase 01]: OOM recovery outside except block to release frame references
- [Phase 01]: CPU benchmark returns default 32 (skip slow binary search)
- [Phase 01]: MPS memory via psutil unified memory + torch.mps.current_allocated_memory()
